description: >-
  Diagnoses a failed Databricks job run: fetches telemetry, classifies the failure into one of
  11 standardized error categories, and spawns two independent root-cause-analysis (Cat L) agent
  instances to adversarially confirm whether a code fix is genuinely possible before anything
  gets changed. Use standalone for ad-hoc triage of a Databricks job failure ("job 91004 failed,
  what's wrong with it", "diagnose run 48213"), or invoked as Phase 2 of opsbuddy-fix with
  telemetry already fetched. Read-only — never applies a fix or opens a PR itself.

# databricks-debug

**Argument**: a Databricks job run ID. Used standalone for ad-hoc triage, or invoked from
opsbuddy-fix Phase 2 with telemetry already fetched (skip Step 1 in that case).

**Not project-portable** — calls `workflow/databricks_workflow.py`, which lives in a specific
repo. Only works when that repo is the current project (see the `opsbuddy-fix` skill's note).

---

## Step 1 — Gather Telemetry

```
# Preferred — opsbuddy_mcp (not yet registered; placeholder for when it is)
mcp__opsbuddy_mcp__getJobRunDetails(run_id="$ARGUMENTS")

# Fallback — real, tested today
python workflow/databricks_workflow.py get-run-failure --run-id $ARGUMENTS
```
Capture the full stack trace, error message, cluster ID, and task parameters — do not truncate.

---

## Step 2 — Classify the Error

| Error category | How to identify | Typically `CODE_FIX_POSSIBLE` |
|---|---|---|
| Schema Mismatch | `AnalysisException`, `cannot resolve column`, schema evolution errors | true |
| Out-of-Memory (OOM) / Executor Lost | `ExecutorLostFailure`, `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`, `Container killed by YARN` | false (unless caused by an obvious unbounded collect/join in code) |
| Null Pointer / NoneType | `NullPointerException`, `NoneType has no attribute` | true |
| Syntax Error | `SyntaxError`, `IndentationError`, `ParseException` | true |
| Permission / Access Denied | `AccessDeniedException`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `403` | false |
| Data Not Found at Source | `FileNotFoundException`, `Path does not exist`, empty source partition | false |
| Cluster Timeout / Startup Failure | `Cluster did not start`, `INSTANCE_UNREACHABLE`, spot eviction | false |
| Dependency / Library Import Error | `ModuleNotFoundError`, `ImportError`, library install failure | true |
| Data Skew / Partition Explosion | task duration outliers, `TooManyPartitionsException` | true (if code-level partitioning fix applies) |
| Upstream Task Dependency Failure | task `state.result_state == UPSTREAM_FAILED` | false (fix belongs in the upstream job) |
| Infrastructure / Cloud Provider Error | `InternalError`, cloud provider 5xx, network errors | false |

Pick the single best-matching category from the stack trace signature. This is a
**preliminary** classification — Step 3's agents may confirm or override it.

---

## Step 3 — Invoke root-cause-analysis (Cat L) — Adversarial Double-Check

`CODE_FIX_POSSIBLE` gates whether opsbuddy-fix is allowed to push a code change — one LLM
judgment call is not enough of a guardrail. Spawn **two independent instances** of the
`root-cause-analysis` subagent (Cat L) in parallel, each given identical input (full stack
trace, error message, task parameters, the Step 2 preliminary category and guess) but **no
visibility into each other's answer**.

Each returns:
```
ERROR_CATEGORY: <one of the 11 standardized categories>
ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY: <2-4 sentences>
CODE_FIX_POSSIBLE: <true|false>
AFFECTED_FILES: <comma-separated repo-relative paths, or "none">
SUGGESTED_FIX_APPROACH: <concrete, minimal, one-paragraph plan>
CONFIDENCE: <high|medium|low>
```

**Reconcile:**

| Agreement | Action |
|---|---|
| Both `true`, same category | Proceed with either verdict's `AFFECTED_FILES`/`SUGGESTED_FIX_APPROACH` (prefer higher `CONFIDENCE` if they differ in detail) |
| Both `false` | Proceed to halt — agreement on "not fixable" is just as actionable as agreement on "fixable" |
| **Disagree** on `CODE_FIX_POSSIBLE` | **Fail closed**: treat as `false`. Surface both verdicts verbatim so a human sees exactly where they diverged. Never average, guess, or pick one arbitrarily. |
| Either reports `CONFIDENCE: low` | Surface that explicitly regardless of agreement |

---

## Step 4 — Report

Return the reconciled verdict block (or both verdicts plus the "disagree → fail closed" note),
plus a plain-English one-paragraph root-cause summary. If invoked standalone, also state whether
a manual fix or `opsbuddy-fix $ARGUMENTS` is the appropriate next step.
